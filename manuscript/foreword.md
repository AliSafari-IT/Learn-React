# Foreword

The Road to learn React teaches the fundamentals of React. You will build a real-world application in plain React without complicated tooling. Everything from project setup to deployment on a server will be explained for you. The book comes with additional referenced reading material and exercises with each chapter. After reading the book, you will be able to build your own applications in React. The material is kept up to date by myself and the community.

In the Road to learn React, I offer a foundation before you dive into the broader React ecosystem. The concepts will have less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information about React. It explains general concepts, patterns, and best practices in a real world React application.

Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side and server-side searching, and advanced interactions like sorting. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.

## About the Author

I am a German software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching programming in JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I continued learning on my own. I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.

For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements, developing large scale applications. The company offered a SaaS product that enables customers to give feedback to businesses. This application was developed using JavaScript on its frontend, and Java as its backend. The first iteration of Small Improvements' frontend was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for its frontend application. After using Angular for over two years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications, so they made the jump to React and Redux. This enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

During my time in the company, I regularly wrote articles about web development on my website. I received great feedback from people learning from my articles which allowed me to improve my writing and teaching style. Article after article, I grew my ability to teach others. I felt that my first articles were packed with too much information, quite overwhelming for students, but I improved by focusing on one subject at a time.

Currently, I am a self-employed software engineer and educator. I find it a fulfilling pastime to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops.

## FAQ

**How to get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive notification the book has changed, you can download a new version of it from my website.

**Is the learning material up-to-date?**

Programming books are usually outdated soon after their release, but since this book is self-published, I can update it as needed whenever a new version of something related to this book gets released.

**Can I get a digital copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you have bought the book on Amazon, you may have seen that the book is available on my website too. Since I use Amazon as one way to monetize my often free content, I honestly thank you for your support and invite you to sign up on [my website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/). After creating an account there, write me an email about your purchase with a receipt from Amazon, so that I can unlock the content for you. With an account on my platform, you always have access to the latest version of the book.

Also, if you have purchased a print book, make sure to take notes in the book. It was my intention to keep the printed book extra large, for the sake of giving larger code snippets enough space, but also for giving you enough space to work with it.

**How can I get help while reading the book?**

The book has a [Slack Community](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who are reading along. You can join the channel to get help, or to help others, as helping others may help you internalize your own understanding.

**Can I help to improve the content?**

If you have feedback, shoot me an email and I will take your suggestions into consideration. Don't expect any replies for bug tracking or troubleshoots though, because that's what's the Slack Community for.

**How to support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [about page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover ways to improve their web development skills. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material.

**What's your motivation behind the book?**

I want to teach about this topic consistently. I often find materials online that don't receive updates, or only applies to a small part of a topic. Sometimes people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to provide this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. Also, I hope I can support the less fortunate with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/).

## Challenge

Personally I write a lot about my lessons learned. That's how I got where I am right now. You are teaching a topic at its best when you have just learned about it yourself. Since teaching helped me a lot in my career, I want you to experience the same effects of it. But first you have to do the cause: teaching yourself. My challenge for the book is the following: teach others what you are learning while reading the book. A couple of breakpoints on how you could achieve it:

* Write a blog post about a specific topic from the book. It's not about copying and pasting the material but rather about teaching the topic your own way. Find your own words to explain something, grab a problem and solve it, and dive even more into the topic by understanding every detail about it. Then teach it to others in this one article. You will see how it fills your knowledge gaps, because you have to dig deeper into the topic, and how it opens doors for your career in the long term.

* If you are active on social media, grab a couple of things you have learned while reading the book and share them with your friends. For instance, you can tweet a hot tip on Twitter about your last learning from the book which may be interesting for others too. Just take a screenshot of the passage of the book or even better: write about it in your own words. That's how you can get into teaching without investing much time.

* If you feel confident recording your learning adventure, share your way through the book on Facebook Live, YouTube Live or Twitch. It helps you to stay concentrated and work your way through the book. Even though you don't have many people following your live session, you can always use the video to put it on YouTube afterward. Besides it is a great way to verbalize your problems and how you are going to solve them.

In the end, you can reach out to me for promoting anything you have released. For instance, if the video turns out well, I would love to include it in this book as officially supplementary material. Just reach out to me once you finished it. After all, I hope you accept this challenge to enhance your learning experience while reading the book which also may help others. I wish you all the best for it.
